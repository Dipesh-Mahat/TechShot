# Analytics Setup Guide for TechShot

## Current Status
Your popular posts section is **currently manual** and needs to be updated manually. I've created both automatic and manual solutions for you.

## Option 1: Automatic Analytics (Recommended)

### What I've Added:
1. **analytics.js** - Tracks page views automatically
2. **Updated popular posts** - Now shows view counts
3. **Analytics dashboard** - View detailed statistics at `/analytics.html`

### How It Works:
- **Local Tracking**: Uses browser localStorage to track views immediately
- **Google Analytics Ready**: Just add your Google Analytics ID
- **Auto-Updates**: Popular posts automatically reorder based on view counts

### Setup Steps:

1. **Get Google Analytics ID**:
   - Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
   - Create account and property for your website
   - Get your Measurement ID (looks like: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

2. **Update Analytics Code**:
   - Open `assets/js/analytics.js`
   - Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual Google Analytics ID
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID'); // Replace with G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

3. **View Analytics**:
   - Visit `/analytics.html` to see detailed statistics
   - Popular posts will auto-update based on actual views

### Benefits:
âœ… **Automatic updates** - No manual work needed
âœ… **Real view tracking** - Actual visitor data
âœ… **Professional analytics** - Detailed insights
âœ… **Live updates** - Popular posts change automatically

## Option 2: Manual Tracking (Simple)

If you prefer to manually update popular posts:

### How to Track Views Manually:

1. **Use Google Analytics** (free):
   - Add Google Analytics to your site
   - Check "Behavior > Site Content > All Pages" weekly
   - Note which articles have most page views

2. **Use GitHub Pages built-in analytics** (if available):
   - Check your repository insights
   - Look at traffic data

3. **Simple manual method**:
   - Ask readers to comment on popular articles
   - Monitor social media shares
   - Track which articles get shared most

### How to Update Popular Posts Manually:

1. **Edit index.html**:
   ```html
   <!-- Update the popular posts section -->
   <div class="popular-posts">
     <h3>Popular Posts</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <a href="articles/your-most-viewed-article.html">
           <span class="post-title">Your Most Popular Article</span>
           <span class="post-date">Date</span>
         </a>
       </li>
       <!-- Add more based on your data -->
     </ul>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Update weekly/monthly** based on your analytics data

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

1. **Start with automatic tracking** (analytics.js)
2. **Monitor the analytics dashboard** weekly
3. **Manually adjust** if needed for editorial control

## Current Features Added:

### 1. Live View Tracking

### 2. Analytics Dashboard
- Visit `/analytics.html` to see:
  - Total views across all articles
  - Most popular articles
  - Recent activity
  - Analytics settings

### 3. Visual Indicators

- View count badges on popular posts
- Real-time updates

## How to Monitor Popular Posts:

### Daily:
- Check the homepage - popular posts auto-update

### Weekly:
- Visit `/analytics.html` for detailed insights
- Review which articles are trending

### Monthly:
- Analyze patterns in popular content
- Plan future articles based on popular topics

## Troubleshooting:

### Popular Posts Not Updating?
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure analytics.js is loading properly
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Want to Reset View Counts?
```javascript
// Run in browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('articleViews');
location.reload();
```

### Want to Add Custom Articles?
Edit the articles array in `analytics.js`:
```javascript
const articles = [
  {
    title: "Your New Article Title",
    path: "/articles/your-new-article.html",
    date: "June 1, 2025"
  },
  // ... existing articles
];
```

## Recommendations:

1. **Use Option 1 (Automatic)** - Set up Google Analytics for best results
2. **Check analytics weekly** - Stay informed about your content performance
3. **Let popular posts auto-update** - Saves time and shows real data
4. **Use the dashboard** - Make data-driven content decisions
